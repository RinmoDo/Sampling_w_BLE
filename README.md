ESP-IDF Sending Data via BLE
=============================

This project is for analysing vibration data via a mobile phone.

the purpose of this code is to make an accurate and high resolution data acquisition from a vibration (accelerometer) sensor, and then send it via BLE ( Bluethoot Low Energy) to a mobile Phone which is linked to a platform where we can do the analyse part.
